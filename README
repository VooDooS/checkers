certification script: prover.sh

This script certifies a list of cerificate names which are in the exported TJPATH (see the Makefile).
The current directory is included.

Certifiacates are of the following form:
1) a certificate mod file must accumulate the implementation of the kernel, clerks and experts that it is using.
2) then a predicate problem/4 with the following arguments:
  1) a name
  2) a formula (right now in the syntax of the used kernel but should be changed into fol and we need to add a polarize relation from fol to target syntax)
  3) a certificate
  4) a map object from index to formulas

Examples of such certificates can be found in tests/resolution

To run the script, type

$ ./prover.sh <list of cert filenames>

for example

$ ./prover.sh bfol1 bprop4
